## The complete code is in Code_1.1387.ipynb, the codes used to determine the parameters are train_net_v2_val_loss_0.95683.py and train_net_b4_val_loss_1.03572.py.
## The files of test_features and train_features and weights are too big to upload to the github, so I used WinRAR to compress it into several parts, if you want to run the whole code, you can download the rar files and unzip them separately.
